# T-seq
Monosynth stepsequencer v. 0.02 for iPad 

Control external midi-synthesizer with iPad sequencer. 
Work in progress. 

Atm. sequencer works in simulator (f.e. midi out -> Audio Midi Studio / Connect -> Logic Pro )
GUI is a mess and todo-list is long. In v. 0.03 I'll support old iPad which I happen to have, and
will be able to test the hardware.

T-seq uses AudioKit framework.
